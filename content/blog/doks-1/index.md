## How to upgrade

You can upgrade to Doks 1.0 by following the [Upgrade to v1](/upgrade-guides/upgrade-to-v1/) migration guide.

## Quick start

Create a new Hyas + Doks project by running the following command:

{{< tabs "create-new-site" >}}
{{< tab "npm" >}}

```bash
npm create hyas@latest -- --template doks
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "pnpm" >}}

```bash
pnpm create hyas@latest -- --template doks
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Yarn" >}}

```bash
yarn create hyas@latest -- --template doks
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

This will create a new [project directory](/docs/basics/project-structure/) with all the necessary files and configurations for your site.
